## ðŸ’¡ TIPS

- **Bypassing KYC Platforms:** To activate our virtual camera on platforms such as Onfido, Sumsub, Veriff, Trulioo, IDnow, and other KYC services, please ensure you are using Firefox as your browser.For proper functionality, integrate the app module via LSPosed, as demonstrated in our tutorial videos. The camera spoofing feature may not work reliably in other browsers, but it operates smoothly and flawlessly with Firefox.We are continuously working to expand compatibility with additional browsers for a seamless experience in the future.

- **Video Playback Guidelines :** To ensure smooth playback, the video must match the platform's broadcast format. We recommend using resolutions like 9:16 aspect ratios, such as 3840x2160, 1920x1080, 1280x720, 854x480, 640x360, 426x240, or 256x144

- **Troubleshooting Camera Issues :** If you experience a black screen or camera activation failure due to video decoding issues, try flipping the camera multiple times to resolve it


- **Screen Flip Misalignment :** If the screen is flipped incorrectly and doesnâ€™t align with the original video, the broadcast settings might need adjustment. In this case, manually adjust the video display within OBS


- **Decoding Compatibility :** Different software has unique requirements for hardware and software decoding. If you encounter issues where audio plays but the video does not, switch to an alternative video decoding method


- **Hard vs. Soft Decoding :** While hard decoding often provides smoother playback, its compatibility depends on your mobile device. Soft decoding is generally more adaptable and ensures the video plays correctly on most devices


- **No Demo Keys Provided :** We do not offer demo activation keys. All features and instructions are clearly demonstrated in the provided videos. Please watch them to fully understand how VirtuCam works and decide if the app meets your needs before purchasing
